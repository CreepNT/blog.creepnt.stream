`Paradox: This message doesn't exist` is a dummy string returned by a routine in the Insomniac Games engine for Ratchet & Clank 1 attempting to lookup an inexistant localized string. This string was changed to `(unavailable)` in Ratchet & Clank 2 but returned to its roots with a concise yet descriptive `Paradox ERR` for Ratchet & Clank 3.
